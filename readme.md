# Test Reuse Analysis
This project aims to analyze data of an ongoing experiment in context of test reuse. It gets raw data in `csv` format containing different metrics. Then it analyzes the data and aggregates them in various tables. The project also draws many plots that can extract valuable insights from the data.

Two important libraries used in the project are [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [`seanborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). The responsibilities of the project can be summarized into following aspects:

1. Preprocessing of data
1. Data aggregation
1. Providing insight in form of plots

More information will be available later.
